# Typescript Starter

This is a TypeScript project template with useful pre-made packages and configurations. It includes ESLint and Prettier for code formatting, Jest for testing (I use Babel as a JavaScript transpiler for Jest), and Husky, along with lint-staged, to ensure a pre-commit process that performs type checking, enforces proper formatting, and runs the tests.

## Usage
Clone the repo and replace the example parts with your code, remove the .git folder and redo the git initialization.

Compile the project:
```bash
    npm run build
```
Compile the project and watch for changes:
```bash
    npm run watch
```
Run the project:
```bash
    npm run start
```
Run the tests:
```bash
    npm run test
```
Run the linter:
```bash
    npm run lint
```
Fix the linter errors:
```bash
    npm run lint-fix
```
